### events ###
 frontier.0.t:0 "The Wild Wild Frontier"
 frontier.0.d:0 "If Nova Griffonia was considered a backwater within the Griffon Empire, one can only imagine what most civilized folk back home thought of the Frontier. The countryside is infested with bandits, cannibals and overall lunatics, what few towns there are survive mostly by providing food and goods for the various bands of criminals, and to make it worse the politicians and officials are corrupt and useless. To put it quite shortly and pleasantly welcome to the Frontier, enjoy your stay."
 frontier.0.a:0 "Why did I even select this country..."
 frontier.1.t:0 "Growel for Funds"
 frontier.1.d:0 "The frontier has had all sorts of issues ever since the first Griffons decided to settle in the town of Frosthill, those issues have been ignored for decades now by incompetent governors. It's gotten to the point where bandits are actually threatening to take over the country! If we do not get funds to at least attempt to address the situation we are doomed!"
 frontier.1.a:0 "Now we just have to convince Teafeather..."
 frontier.2.t:0 "A Miracle"
 frontier.2.d:0 "Trough some miracle we actually managed to get funding from Weter..."
 frontier.2.a:0 "A surprise, but a welcome one"
 frontier.3.t:0 "Expected Result"
 frontier.3.d:0 "Unsuprisingly our begging fell on deaf ears..."
 frontier.3.a:0 "Well we're screwed"
 frontier.4.t:0 "The Comming Storm"
 frontier.4.d:0 "Dark times are ahead of us, bandits are already gathering... for something, and with no funds we most likely won't be able to weather the storm"
 frontier.4.a:0 "Might as well pack my bags."
 frontier.5.t:0 "Apply for Statehood"
 frontier.5.d:0 "After all the turmoil and hardships we've finally managed to more or less fix our situation, and as such we should make a formal request to officially join Nova Griffonia as a proper province."
 frontier.5.a:0 "Here goest nothing..."
 frontier.6.t:0 "A Shipment"
 frontier.6.d:0 "All we've managed to buy with our meager funds are some old Stalliongrader rifles from a rather dubious source. It's not much, but it is something."
 frontier.6.a:0 "At least they work"
 frontier.7.t:0 "Virgil Makes a Move"
 frontier.7.d:0 "In yet another unsuprising move, Virgil's Raider's sensing weakness descended from the mountains and took over practically every town in the Frontier with barely any ressistance, taking over the country. Governor Muck has already fled back to Weter to inform the Nova Griffonian authorities of this new development."
 frontier.7.a:0 "Let us see how Teafeather responds..."
 frontier.8.t:0 "Victory"
 frontier.8.d:0 "After a series of spectacular failures on the part of Governor Teafeather the Nova Griffonian soldiers have withdrawn from our borders... we've actually managed to win this war!"
 frontier.8.a:0 "Long live Virgilia!"
 frontier.9.t:0 "The Boiling Point"
 frontier.9.d:0 "Anyone with two eyes could have seen it comming, after months of debating, mutual contempt and conflict of interests the situation between Redtail and Virgil has reached a boiling point. To make matters worse Redtail has already mobilized his Red Guard with the intent to march on Frosthill and seize control of our new Nation."
 frontier.9.a:0 "The Red Guard is beaten back and Redtail flees into the mountains"
 frontier.9.b:0 "Redtail and his Red Guard seize Frosthill and drive Virgil into the mountains"
 frontier.11.t:0 "The Griffons' Proposal"
 frontier.11.d:0 "It seems that the Griffons have embraced Socialism, even better they've decided to send an ambassador in an attempt to join the Socialist Union, what shall we do?"
 frontier.11.a:0 "Allow them to join"
 frontier.11.b:0 "I don't trust those pigeons"
 frontier.12.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepts"
 frontier.12.d:0 "It seems that Stalliongrad has accepted our petition to join their union."
 frontier.12.a:0 "Workers of the world unite!"
 frontier.13.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 frontier.13.d:0 "It seems that Stalliongrad has denied our petition to join their union."
 frontier.13.a:0 "I thought we were beyond secretarianism!"
 frontier.14.t:0 "Long Pork"
 frontier.14.d:0 "Truth be told the Frontier has never lacked in danger. However it takes a special kind of person to wake up one day and decide to eat their fellow citizen, and while many places would have to deal with cannibalism every once in a while we have to deal with it on an almost daily basis... while many of our citizens have accepted this fact at this point needless to say it doesn't exactly help reflect well on our government."
 frontier.14.a:0 "Just another day on the Frontier..."
