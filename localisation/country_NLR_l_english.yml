lunas.23.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Blueblood"
lunas.23.d:0 "The Blueblood that lived before the Civil War might as well be a completely different pony from the stallion standing in front of her majesty's throne today. The responsibility and the stress of the situation have made him into a sight to behold, no longer a whimpering coward the Blueblood standing before us today is a hardened commander and war hero, but most importantly her majesty's nephew... Despite repeated attempts to convince him to join the Lunar Empire he has remained steadfast, thus leaving us with little choice... We must either execute him or exile him."

lunas.23.b:0 "Shoot him, family or not he is still a traitor"

lunas.25.t:0 "Lunar Terror"
lunas.25.d:0 "Your majesty, it has come to our attention that many different parts of our military are showing deep resentment and hatred for the enemy. While this isn’t a bad thing, per se, it carries with it the side effect of increasingly frequent hate crimes against not only prisoners of war but also civilians that now fall under our occupation. The longer the war drags on, the more bitter the troops become, and with their bitterness the crime rate increases."

lunas.28.t:0 "The Situation Down South"
lunas.28.d:0 "It seems that against all odds our few remaining loyal soldiers in the South-East have managed to secure it for our glorious empire! While these are joyous news, perhaps we should consider rewarding Commander Stars Whirl with more autonomy for her actions?"
lunas.28.a:0 "Appoint Commander Stars Whirl as the Governor-General of the South-East"
lunas.28.b:0 "They've fullfiled their purpose, integrate them into the Empire."
