########## focus localisation ######
OLE_army:0 "The State of the Army"
OLE_army_desc:0 "Our armies have always been comparatively small to our neighbors, and thus at a disadvantage. However with the advent of new technologies we can level the playing field with not nubmers, but raw firepower."
OLE_doctrine_2:0 "Bringing out the Big Guns"
OLE_doctrine_2_desc:0 "One of the most useful tools of war ever divised is the humble cannon, and like any other tool it has only improved over the years. Several of our commanders are advocating for a new miltiary doctrine that focuses primarly on overwhelming the enemy trough sheer firepower, but qutie frankly I believe they just like looking at explosions."
OLE_doctrine_1:0 "Deers on Wheels"
OLE_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The so called "tank" is a relatively new invention. The early models were not all that useful, but as the years went on the designs and the firepower slowly improved. Several of our commanders are now advocating a doctrine that would primarly focus on speed and mobility to crush our enemies before they can even react."
OLE_mot:0 "Kuorma"
OLE_mot_desc:0 "The Kuorma or the truck as it is more commonly known to non Oleninans has recently come into use primarly for transporting goods. But several of our tacticians have suggested we strap on some armored plates on to them and see what happens."
OLE_mech:0 "HAK"
OLE_mech_desc:0 "The HAK (Heavily Armoured Kuorma) is not merely an armourmed truck, it is a really well armoured truck with a lot of guns on it. Truly we are the pinnacle of modern military science."
OLE_light_tank:0 "Haakon's Tank Experiments"
OLE_light_tank_desc:0 "Haakon Lurswig one of our more local proponents of tank warfare has suggested we import some tanks from our Equestrian neighbors to experiment on and perhaps even use them as a basis for our own tank projects."
OLE_medium_tank:0 "Medium Armour Effort"
OLE_medium_tank_desc:0 "Suprisingly Haakon's experiment proved a success and have managed to convince most of our high command that tanks and mobile warfare are the way of the future, and thus they have commissioned slightly heavier tanks."
OLE_heavy_tank:0 "Tung Tanks"
OLE_heavy_tank_desc:0 "The Tung tanks are absolute monstrosities on the battlefield, having been equipped with 87MM cannons and thick armor plates on practically every inch of the hull, they are truly a sight to behold."
OLE_tank_making:0 "Mass Mobilization"
OLE_tank_making_desc:0 "We've learnt a lot from our various tank experiments it is only natural that we use that knowledge to standardize production of spare parts, in case any accidents should occur."
OLE_super_tank:0 "The Haakonsønn"
OLE_super_tank_desc:0 "The affectionately named Haakonsønn is quite possibly Lurswig's greatest work, a monstrosity of steel and fire it will crush all who oppose Olenia beneath its treads."
OLE_support:0 "Organic Support"
OLE_support_desc:0 "Our troops can no longer rely on rifles and bayonets alone, modern warfare requires adapatable support troops such as engineers and medics to maintain the equipment and save their fellow soldiers."
OLE_better_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
OLE_better_guns_desc:0 "Our enemies are constantly improving their equipment, and if we do not wish to be left in the dust we must too."
OLE_new_arty:0 "Massed Artillery"
OLE_new_arty_desc:0 "Our new doctrine calls for blowing the enemy sky high trough massed artillery barrages, but most of our cannons are either outdated or too underpowered for such a feat. We must fix this"
OLE_computing:0 "Radio Equipment"
OLE_computing_desc:0 "Considering we will be blowing up a lot of things in the nearby  future easier communication between our troops should be among our top priorities, least we wish to suffer friendly fire."
OLE_electronics:0 "The Perkele Code"
OLE_electronics_desc:0 "The Perkele Code so named after it's creator Colonel Spurdo S. Perkele might be one of the most ingenious code languages ever written, with most cryptologists finding it near impossible to crack. However the truth is it isn't even a code, it's just a jumble of random Olenian words with Perkele's name thrown in there to confuse people."
OLE_better_arty:0 "Thunder and Lighting"
OLE_better_arty_desc:0 "We might as well integrate all we've learnt so far and blow our enemy sky high with massed artillery barrages rather than risk the lives of our men in pointless infantry charges."
OLE_rocketry:0 "The Spurdo Project"
OLE_rocketry_desc:0 "With the Changelings possessing a superior airforce, planes would pose no real threat to them. Innovations in rocket science, however, could prove useful."
OLE_military_academy:0 "Olenian Academy of Practical Science"
OLE_military_academy_desc:0 "The newly established Olenian Academy of Practical Science or OAPS for short will prove useful in ensuring that our army's R&D department dosn't fall behind in creating new and improved equipment for our troops."
