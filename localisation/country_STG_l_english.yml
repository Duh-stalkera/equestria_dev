stalliongrad.0.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad.0.d:0 "More than a decade ago, the great revolutionary named Steel Stallion executed a revolt in the city of Stalliongrad, one of the poorest regions in Equestria, to form a country with a completely new economic and social system, where everypony are given equal opportunities, where everypony are recieving everything according to their needs. The revolt was supported by surrounding cities and villages. Equestrian officials were sent out from the country, when the independence of the Republic of Stalliongard was ancnounced. The Equestrian army command did not want to tolerate that and in several hours Equestrian Royal Army entered the territory of the young republic. The war continued for less than a week, before Princess Celestia personally ordered her troops to stop their advance. Several generals were fired from their posts for their agressive actions. With hopes of a brighter future, the determined ponies of Stalliongrad continue their struggle."
stalliongrad.0.a:0 "Never forget."
stalliongrad.5.t:0 "Civil War in Equestria"
stalliongrad.5.d:0 "Equestiran Civil War has begun. We have a chance to get our territories back when they are weak."
stalliongrad.5.a:0 "Move away!"
stalliongrad.5.b:0 "Let's be quiet for now."
stg_annexes_cores_civil_war:0 "Annex our cores."
stalliongrad.12.t:0 "The Time of Troubles."
stalliongrad.12.d:0 "After more than a decade since establishment of the Republic of Stalliongrad, the future of it has been covered in mist of disputes, political and social stagnation. Promises of better life are not becoming reality. However the masses are not discouraged yet and if we manage to choose the right path, reform our government, finish industrialization and end the food problem, we can rely on our people to support us in every move."
stalliongrad.12.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.13.t:0 "Party Disagreements."
stalliongrad.13.d:0 "When the revolution succeeded, the Stalliongradian Communist Party took contol of the state. For most of that time, the highest ranks in the party have been occupied by Altidiya Revoltsova and Vasiliy Pantsushenko, two earthponies, under leadership of whose Stalliongrad began its transformation into a socialist state. On the course, two ponies started envying each other more and more, after time their leadership has turned into a competition of personal achievements. And the party has split in two groups, each supporting the leader of their preference."
stalliongrad.13.a:0 "It continues."
stalliongrad.14.t:0 "The Construction of the Palace of the Soviets!"
stalliongrad.14.d:0 "Our constructors have strarted to clear the ground in the city centre from the old apartment buildings to make space for the new monumental pairlament building, the Palace of the Soviets."
stalliongrad.14.a:0 "Future awaits!"
stalliongrad.2.t:0 "Different Outlook."
stalliongrad.2.d:0 "On a private meeting of the party members, the situation in the country was discussed, as always. The two leaders expressed different opinions on the first steps to solving the problems that concern many of the citizens today. Altidiya suggested that Stalliongrad requires an expansion of propaganda and educational campaigns in order to make more ponies class-aware and interested in politics, which in the long run will provide us capable ministers and organizers. Vasiliy suggested to relocate resources on supporting the worker cooperatives in Stalliongrad, by that we can finish industrialization quicker."
stalliongrad.2.a:0 "Propaganda broadcasts."
stalliongrad.2.b:0 "Relocate money for industry."
stalliongrad.15.t:0 "Internal Politics."
stalliongrad.15.d:0 "Despite that both leaders have good points and a resonable approach to running the state, it is obvious that Altidiya is currently an inspirational leader for the people and the pony capable of taking the future of Stalliongrad in her own hooves, unlike Vasiliy that had a good start, but rather slowed down to a full stop in the end. We need to take measures against Vasiliy's impulses to seize power in the party and expell him, if necessary."
stalliongrad.15.a:0 "Ladno."
stalliongrad.16.t:0 "Internal Politics."
stalliongrad.16.d:0 "Despite that both leaders have good points and a resonable approach to things in the state, Vasiliy has proven himself as a capable leader. The personal grude between him and Altidiya, however, cannot continue any longer. We must decide to find a compromise between the two leaders or, if there is enough support of the party members, promote Vasiliy as a new candidate for General Secretary post and expell Altidiya from the party, if that is necessary."
stalliongrad.16.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.17.t:0 "Internal Politics."
stalliongrad.17.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them. Recently, Vasiliy demanded a compromise from Altidiya, claiming that he has been doing a great job staying in power under her, saying he wants to recieve desired appreciation and a higher post of General Secretary of the Party, just as Altidiya herself. We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya in the long run."
stalliongrad.17.a:0 "Posmotrim."
stalliongrad.18.t:0 "Internal Politics."
stalliongrad.18.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them.

We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya in the long run."
stalliongrad.18.a:0 "Posmotrim."
stalliongrad.19.t:0 "Altidiya's Focus."
stalliongrad.19.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and after a long debate it has been decided to demote Vasiliy from his post as Prime Minister. His policies led to political and economic stagnation and desolation of the country. It is time for us to move forward and form a new government."
stalliongrad.19.a:0 "Da."
stalliongrad.20.t:0 "The New Government."
stalliongrad.20.d:0 "The time has come for Vasiliy to step back and make way for the new ponies in government. Under cover of night, a group of ponies with Altidiya in charge has seized the Supreme Soviet building. Vasiliy, Sinister, Nestor and other party from the party that supported the other side, in fear of reprisals, have crossed the border and fled to Equestria and the Crystal Empire. The new government with Dark Wing as the head of state was formed."
stalliongrad.20.a:0 "K luchshemu buduschemu."
stalliongrad.21.t:0 "Vasiliy's Frame of Mind."
stalliongrad.21.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and after hours of debates, the party members chose to support Vasiliy's candidacy on the post of General Secretary. The decision was made based on the votes of the soviet representatives, however Altidiya and her supporters, such as General Ponyarchuk refused to give way and step back from the high seat. According to the codex of the party, if, by the end of a debate, where the problem was resolved by a vote, a member that shows disrespect for the opinion of majority and continues to pursue their own interest, they shall be expelled from the party. It is time for us to act!"
stalliongrad.21.a:0 "Da!"
stalliongrad.22.t:0 "Compromise."
stalliongrad.22.d:0 "Luckily, nothing interrupted the soviet on this sunny [GetMonth] day. Tensions between the two party groups were peacefully talked about. The committee came to an agreement that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. The summits will continue until all the questions are discussed and a solution to all of them is found."
stalliongrad.22.a:0 "Way to go."
stalliongrad.23.t:0 "Party Elections!"
stalliongrad.23.d:0 "Since all of the Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party, it is time to elect a new General Secretary. There were several candidates for that post, however, some of them refused to take the responsibility, that leaves us with two main candidates."
stalliongrad.23.a:0 "Let's see."
stalliongrad.24.t:0 "The Power of the Ponies."
stalliongrad.24.d:0 "Arguments in the Supreme Soviet are rising in strength every day. As a more active and radical pony, Altidiya promotes change and openness of the state affairs to the public. Vasiliy argues that to prevent counter-revolution and promote stability, Stalliongrad should stick to the current government and wait for the right moment to act. They both suggest their own vision of the actions to take in the current situation."
stalliongrad.24.a:0 "Jest."
stalliongrad.25.t:0 "The Plans."
stalliongrad.25.d:0 "The summit has been held in the Supreme Council today and Vasiliy suggested that the focus Stalliongrad needs to take is improving its infrastructure all over the country to create more workplaces and connect remote places together. Altidiya offered her plan majoring on military industry in Stalliongrad itself, as the state needs to protect itself. It is up to the soviets to decide what plan are we going to follow."
stalliongrad.25.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.26.t:0 "Pantsushenko's Crew."
stalliongrad.26.d:0 "Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party and their occupations are cleared. The elements Altidiya was about to bring in power were very suspicious, we can with confidence say that we've prevented counter-revolution and collapse of the Stalliongradian state. General Ponyarchuk, Kors Relux, Ivan, Dark Wing are no longer a threat to us. All the old leaders remain on their posts, however, and are ready to continue their work on the path of reaching communism in Stalliongrad."
stalliongrad.26.a:0 "Well deserved."
stalliongrad.27.t:0 "Sinister Serov."
stalliongrad.27.d:0 "Sinister Serov announced his intentions to participate in the elections, obviously. Earlier, he supported Vasily, and was a part of the same coalition with him, but his different view of the solution of state problems made him take a separate stance in this elections. \n Sinnie's speech is demagogic and populistic, he insists on toughening the role of the state in all spheres of society, but at the same time openly expresses his view on ineffectiveness of the collective farm system, and the need to allow market elements in agriculture. The pony has imperialistic ambitions, justified by the struggle against plutocratic enemies, and calls to build up Stalliongrad's hegemony on the continent."
stalliongrad.27.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.28.t:0 "Vasiliy."
stalliongrad.28.d:0 "Vasiliy Pantsushenko was a prime minister after Altidiya whose political rhetoric is characterized by ultra-communist convictions. Vasiliy stands for preserving and toughening the "true-socialist way" of the state ideology and supports interventionistic foreign policy. He has gained paranoia after years of work with Altidiya, that affects his political course in both foreign and internal spheres. He claims he struggles for "purity" of the communist ideas in the party and will to defend the achievements of revolution to an end."
stalliongrad.28.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.29.t:0 "Dark Wing."
stalliongrad.29.d:0 "Darkwing begins his election campaign with an appeal to the ponies of Stalliongrad. Speaking of his goals as the ruler of Stalliongrad, he calls himself loyal to Altidia Coggydeer and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers other party leaders to be corrupt and incompetent, and lays the blame of famine and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n The politician saw the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat represented by changelings."
stalliongrad.29.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.30.t:0 "Elections!"
stalliongrad.30.d:0 "We are gathered here today to elect a new General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. The decisions of the general secretary are going to be most influential in the state's foreign and internal politics. We have two candidates to choose from."

stalliongrad.32.d:0 "News come from the office. Unexpectedly Altidiya resigns from her post as the General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. It is said that her health has been worsening all these years. She was advised to leave Stalliongrad and move into a calm summer camp Sovenok in the northern woods of the country."
stalliongrad.32.a:0 "Long live."
stalliongrad.32.a:0 "Long live."
stalliongrad.34.t:0 "Urgent Elections."
stalliongrad.34.d:0 "Altidiya has retired due to her poor health condition. She is no longer capable of managing the state on General Secretary post. The Supreme Soviet declares elections for a new leader for that occupation. Candidates have two months to debate and show themselves as good contenders."
stalliongrad.34.a:0 "Uvidim."
stalliongrad.35.t:0 "Ten Conditions."
stalliongrad.35.d:0 "[GetDate]. On today's summit it was decided to finally reconcile the two leaders. Listing his ten conditions to Altidiya, he demanded them all to be met by her. He exlaimed that if the head of state refuses them, Vasiliy is going to leave the party."
stalliongrad.35.a:0 "Keep the party stable."
stalliongrad.35.b:0 "Decline the demand."
stalliongrad.36.t:0 "Dark Wing seizes power."
stalliongrad.36.d:0 "Under cover of night Dark Wing and his collaborators have set the Supreme Soviet building on fire. In the morning the blame for these actions was put on Vasiliy's supporters. Dark Wing took control of the state apparatus by enacting state of emergency in the capital. The Vasiliy's supporters were forced to leave the city."
stalliongrad.36.a:0 "Uh-huh."
stalliongrad.37.t:0 "Dark Wing."
stalliongrad.37.d:0 "After Polya's retirement there're no ponies that we can turn to other than the second leader after her, Dark Wing. he calls himself loyal to Altidia Coggydeer and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers former party members to be corrupt and incompetent, he lays the blame of food problems and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n Dark Wing sees the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat of changelings."
stalliongrad.37.a:0 "Okay."
stalliongrad.4000.t:0 "Landowners and petite bourgeoisie rebel!"
stalliongrad.4000.d:0 "Big landowners that were not persecuted when the collectivization started now have freedom to continue their exploitation of free peasant ponies. They start to quickly monopolize the fragile food market. We need to enact stronger market regulations, provide social and finanical security for free farmers."
stalliongrad.4000.a:0 "Tak."

stalliongrad.44.d:0 "Most ponies are happy that the state officials finally decided to support the wide-spread collectivization movement to deprive the old land-lords and wealthy peasants from owning the rich cultivated soil.
