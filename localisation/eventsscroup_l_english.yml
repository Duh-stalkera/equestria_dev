starlight.3.t:0 "Abolition of Equality"
starlight.3.d:0 ""Our Town" was founded by Starlight Glimmer, it was a place to which all ponies, who were unhappy, bullied, made fun of because of their cutiemarks came, seeking for shelter. Starlight was the spiritual leader of these outsiders, outshied by magical talent of her friend Sunburst, she wanted to create a society where all the ponies would be happy and equal, a place without envy and grudge. Using a magical crystal, this unicorn took away ponies' cutiemarks. Soon it was realized that without cutiemarks, individual talents of the equines is lost as well, in fact, spirits and life power died inside them. The experiment was a failure. Starlight left the town and became a student of the Princess of Friendship in Equestria. All on their own, the citizens of Our Town started to build their own future, greatly influenced by their communist neighbors. Our Town was reformed into a socialist commune, Enlightened Equality, as some call it."
